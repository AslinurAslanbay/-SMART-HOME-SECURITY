# -SMART-HOME-SECURITY

This project is a smart home security system that uses machine learning and image processing to recognize visitors at the door. A camera placed near the entrance captures the visitor's face, and the system identifies the person using facial recognition techniques. If a visitor is detected, an SMS notification is automatically sent to the homeowner. The project uses machine learning algorithms and computer vision libraries to ensure accurate and real-time recognition.
